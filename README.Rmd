# GoodPackage

The goal of GoodPackage is to randomly generate dwarf names (and be an example package).

## Installation

You can install the development version of GoodPackage from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JohMast/GoodPackage")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to create a dwarf:

```{r example}
library(GoodPackage)
print_dwarf()
```

If you want your dwarves to be less metal:

```{r}
print_dwarf(make_more_metal = F)
```

If you want your dwarves to be of a specific age range:

```{r}
print_dwarf(min_age = 29,max_age = 40)
```

If you want several dwarves:
```{r}
sapply(1:10,print_dwarf)
```
